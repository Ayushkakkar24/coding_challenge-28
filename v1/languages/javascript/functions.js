    "verything in JavaScript happens in functions. A function is a block of code, self contained, that can be defined once and run any times you want. A function can optionally accept parameters, and returns one value. Functions in JavaScript are objects, a special kind of objects: function objects. Their superpower lies in the fact that they can be invoked. In addition, functions are said to be first class functions because they can be assigned to a value, and they can be passed as arguments and used as a return value.",
  example: "function addUp(a, b) { return a + b }; addUp(5,6) // 11   ",
};

module.exports = Functions;
