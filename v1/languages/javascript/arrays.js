  description:
    "Arrays are list-like objects whose prototype has methods to perform traversal and mutation operations. Neither the length of a JavaScript array nor the types of its elements are fixed. Since an array's length can change at any time, and data can be stored at non-contiguous locations in the array, JavaScript arrays are not guaranteed to be dense; this depends on how the programmer chooses to use them. You can declare them using square brackets. Items are separated by comma's and are zero-bases. So the first item starts at zero.",
  example: "var list = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']; // console.log(list[0]) // 'a' ",
};

module.exports = Arrays;
